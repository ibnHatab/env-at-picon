Presentation of ASN.1-Diff mode
*******************************

Introduction
============

   The ASN.1-Diff mode allows to compare the old version and the new
one of the same ASN.1 specification, or two specifications which are
similar.  It uses Asnp, a parser used as a comparator of ASN.1:1997
specifications, developped by France Te'le'com R&D
(asn1@rd.francetelecom.fr).  This tool is run automatically and the
result is inserted in an Emacs buffer.  The ASN.1 files of the
specifications are opened and the differences are highlighted.  A
simple mouse click on an Asnp message shows the corresponding
differences. Likewise, a click on a highlighted difference in an ASN.1
file shows the corresponding message.  It is then possible to execute
some operations: selection of messages, insertion of Asnp messages in
the files, printing files ...

Keybindings
===========

   All ASN.1-Diff commands are accessible from the menu "ASN.1-Diff".
The associated keybindings are printed in the menu near the
corresponding item to memorize them more easily.

   The keybindings of the Diff buffer (the buffer in which the messages
of Asnp are displayed) are single letters (ex: `n' for going to the
next message).  All the keybindings given in this document concern the
Diff buffer.

   In an ASN.1 buffer, all these keybindings are accessible by typing
`C-c' before (ex: `C-c n').  It is impossible to type directly `n'
because it would insert the letter "n".

   A list of the main keybindings is given by the command "Help" of the
"ASN.1-Diff" menu.

   To list all keybindings, type `C-h b'.

Installation
============

   This module is normally installed with the others Emacs files of the
ASN.1 mode.  The only things to do is to check that the Asnp command is
correctly defined.  If the ASN.1 mode for Emacs has already been
installed, there should be no problem.

   Refer to the next section for testing. If it does not work, modify
the comparison command with the "Fast customization" sub-menu and save
it (select the last item of the same sub-menu).

Start of a comparison
*********************

   The ASN.1-Diff mode allow to compare two ASN.1 specifications.  To
start a comparison, type `M-x asn1-diff'. If an ASN.1 file is opened,
the item "Compare two specification" or the keybinding `C-c C-d' of the
ASN.1 menu can be used.

   Then, enter the names of the files of the new and the old
specification.  You can specify several files if needed:
     New specification : ~/new/*.asn ~/fred.asn
     Old specification : ~/old/*.asn ~/jack.asn

   The tool Asnp is then automatically started for doing the comparison.

   When the comparison is over, the Asnp messages are highlighted.  The
buffer where the Asnp messages are displayed is called the Diff buffer.

   All the files corresponding to these errors are opened and the
differences are highlighted.  It is thus easy to see them.  It is
possible to desactivate the color with the menu or by typing `c' (If
you don't want to color the differences at startup, see  *Note Fast
customization: Customization.).

   To show the differences corresponding to a message, click on it with
button 2 of the mouse (right button for the mouses with 2 buttons).

   Likewise, to show the message corresponding to a difference, click
(with the same button) on a difference. This difference will be
highlighted and the corresponding message will be the first displayed
at the top of the Diff buffer.

   It is possible to edit the ASN.1 files after the comparison.  If
some differences are removed, the associated message will still be
present in the Diff buffer. To actualise, update the comparison
(keybinding: `!').

   The Asnp messages are sorted according to the new specification,
first by alphabetical order of file names and then by line and column
numbers. Thus, typing `n' allows to go to the next difference.

   To desactivate the sort option, see *Note Customization::.

   A comparison between big files can take a long time.  For this
reason, it is possible to save the result of a comparison: save simply
the Diff buffer (`C-x C-s'). Name the file with extension `.asnd'.
Then, open this file with Emacs and the previous context will be
restored: all ASN.1 files will be opened, the differences highlighted...

   If some ASN.1 buffers are killed, it is possible not to restart the
comparison but simply reread the Asnp messages in the Diff buffer (item
"Reread Diff buffer", `S').

   To definitively quit the ASN.1-Diff mode, select the item "Quit" of
the menu (keybinding: `q'). The diff menu will be erased and the
differences no more highlighted.

`<RET>'
     Show the difference corresponding to the current message

`<SPC>' or `n'
     Show the difference corresponding to the next message

`<BS>' or `<DEL>' or `p'
     Show the difference corresponding to the previous message
     (`<BS>' is the Backspace key)

Windows
*******

The display is composed of three windows:

   - a window where the files of the new specification are displayed,

   - a window where the files of the old specification are displayed,

   - the window of the Diff buffer.

   The presentation of the windows can be modified (see *Note
Customization::).  Resizing the emacs window to the overall screen size
improves the layout.

   NB: to modify the size of an Emacs windows, click with the left
button on its boundary.

   To scroll simultaneously the two windows where modules are displayed,
press `v' (down) or `V' (up).

   The command "Exit Temporarily" of the menu kills these windows.

   It is possible to restore them by clicking on a message or by
selecting the item "Restore Windows" of the menu.  The command "Restart
Windows" undoes the modifications performed on the window size.

`w q' or `e'
     kill the windows

`w r'
     reorganize the windows

`w s'
     restore the windows

Selecting messages
******************

Messages can be selected to be handled by the following operations:
   - inserting these messages in the ASN.1 modules (see *Note Insertion
     of Asnp messages::);

   - highlighting only these messages (useful when printing the files).

   It is thus possible to ignore some messages. An ignored message is
never inserted in the modules. Keys `n' and `p' (next and previous
messages) ignore these messages. To go to the next or previous actual
message, use keys `N' or `P'.

`m'
     mark a message

`i' or `d'
     ignore a message

`u'
     unmark a message

To select group of messages :

`a m'
     mark all messages

`a i' or `a d'
     ignore all messages

`a u'
     unmark all messages

`a w'
     ignore all warnings

   Note: for ignoring all warnings at startup, see *Note
Customization::.

Insertion of Asnp messages
**************************

   It is possible to insert Asnp messages in the files, in place of the
differences.  Select the item "Insert Messages in Modules" of
"ASN.1-Diff" menu.

   The sub-menu "More Insertions" gives the possibility to insert only
marked messages or to insert a text instead of the messages.

   Note: an ignored message (See *Note Selecting messages::) is never
inserted in the modules.

   It is possible to undo an insertion.

   After an insertion, all ASN.1 buffers  are modified. It is possible
to save all of them.

`r' or `R m'
     insert the messages

`R M'
     insert only marked messages

`R t'
     ask for a text and insert it

`R M'
     ask for a text and insert it only on place of marked differences

`R u'
     undo an insertion

`s'
     save all ASN.1 buffers


File: asn1-diff.info,  Node: Impression of files,  Next: Customization,  Prev: Insertion of Asnp messages,  Up: Top

Impression of files
*******************

An item of the "ASN.1-Diff" menu allows to print all ASN.1 files of the
compared specifications (keybinding: `p').  The highlighted text will
always be printed highlighted (so that differences are easy to find).

   A menu item allows to highlight only the differences corresponding
to the marked messages (`o').  To restore the color, press the `c' key
twice (item "Colors On/Off" of the menu).

Customization
*************

   Note: it is not necessary to do a comparison to display the menu
"ASN.1-Diff". Just select the item "Show Diff Menu" of the sub-menu
"Fast Customization" of the menu "ASN.1"

Fast customization
==================

   The sub-menu "Fast Customization" allows to change some options
easily, like turning on/off highlighting at startup and changing the
comparison command and switches.

`O'
     change the comparison switches

`P'
     change the comparison command

Options
=======

The options are:
   - comparison command;

   - comparison switches;

   - highlighting at startup;

   - ignoring all warnings at startup;

   - windows configuration;

   - size of the Diff windows;

   - confirmation before quitting;

   - asking for saving all buffers before comparison;

   - highlighting all Asnp messages when the mouse points at its;

   - sort the Asnp messages;

   - text to insert by default;

   - vertically center the differences in the windows;

   - cut the too large lines;

   - name of the Diff buffer.

Colors
======

   A buffer similar to a "customize" buffer allows to modify all the
colors used in the mode.

   It is also possible to choose to not highlight at startup with the
sub-menu "Fast Customization".
